- The **History** view lists uploads, training jobs, evaluations, and deployments in chronological order.
- Each entry shows status, timestamps, initiating user, and key identifiers (dataset, model ID, artifact path).
- Use filters (type, status, tags) to narrow results when auditing changes or diagnosing regressions.
