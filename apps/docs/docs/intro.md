# Welcome to DeepFinery Docs

DeepFinery distils financial rulebooks into deterministic small language models. Use this documentation set to understand the ingestion pipeline, ontology generation, training workflows, and deployment guides.

## Quick Start

1. Provision Cognito, S3, and DocumentDB resources via the infrastructure repository.
2. Clone `training-studio` and follow the README to configure backend/frontend `.env` files.
3. Use Docker Compose to run the backend, frontend, and this docs site locally.

## What’s Next?

- Check out the **Training Studio** section for configuring LoRA/QLoRA jobs.
- Read the **Ingestion Pipeline** topics to prepare datasets.
- Visit the **Deployments** section to ship artifacts to EKS or edge targets.

More sections will appear here as the platform evolves.
